# LSC

We want to create a new interpreted programing language, for educational and world domination purposes.

- The first step is pose the language features, if the language is typed or dynamic, set a general idea for the syntax, etc.

- Second step is define the tools to be used.

- Third, we must create the grammar analyzer, syntax analyzer, the interpreter, and etc etc...
